SOC Alert Investigation Portfolio

This repository showcases hands-on Security Operations Center (SOC) investigations involving phishing detection, firewall threat prevention, and alert triage.

Each case study demonstrates my ability to:
- Analyze security alerts
- Correlate email and network telemetry
- Identify phishing techniques
- Assess organizational risk
- Recommend remediation actions
-  Escalate incidents appropriately

These investigations reflect real-world analyst workflows aligned with modern SOC practices.

Skills Demonstrated

- Threat Detection & Analysis
- Phishing Investigation
- Firewall Log Analysis
- Incident Triage
- Security Alert Classification
- Indicator of Compromise (IOC) Identification
- Risk Assessment
- Security Escalation Decision-Making

  Tools & Technologies

- SIEM / Alert Monitoring Platform
- Email Security Analysis
- Firewall Telemetry
- Threat Intelligence Concepts
- SOC Investigation Methodology
  
If the phishing attack had been successful, the organization could have faced:

- Credential compromise
- Unauthorized account access
- Data exfiltration
- Business email compromise (BEC)
- Lateral movement within the network

Early detection and firewall controls significantly reduced organizational risk.
 Investigation Process

- Reviewed alert metadata including sender domain and embedded URLs.
- Identified phishing indicators such as brand impersonation and URL obfuscation.
- Correlated email artifacts with firewall telemetry.
- Confirmed outbound connection attempt was blocked.
